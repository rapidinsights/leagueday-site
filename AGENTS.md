# LeagueDay Site Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

Marketing site for LeagueDay (golf league management for public courses), built on the AstroWind template with **Astro v7** and **Tailwind CSS v4**. Fully static, deployed on **Netlify** (`netlify.toml`), managed with **pnpm**. The blog and dark mode are off.

Colors and type come from the LeagueDay app's design system (Linen · Stone · Bottle, Schibsted Grotesk). Its source of truth is `web/app/globals.css` in the leagueday repo; `src/components/CustomStyles.astro` copies the values.

**Stack:** Astro v7 | Tailwind CSS v4 | TypeScript 5.9 | MDX | Sharp

## Skills

Before implementing a project-specific task (disabling the blog, Open Graph images, base paths, CMS, deployments, header customisation…), check `.agents/skills/` for an existing skill and follow it.

## Quick Reference

| Command        | Purpose                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`     | Start dev server at localhost:4321  |
| `pnpm build`   | Production build to `./dist/`       |
| `pnpm preview` | Preview production build locally    |
| `pnpm check`   | Run astro check + ESLint + Prettier |
| `pnpm fix`     | Auto-fix ESLint + Prettier issues   |

**Node.js requirement:** >= 22.22.3

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

```

    ui/            # Primitives: Button, Form, Headline, Timeline, WidgetWrapper

  utils/               # blog.ts, images.ts, permalinks.ts, frontmatter.ts
  config.yaml          # Site configuration (loaded as virtual module)
  navigation.ts        # Navigation structure
  types.d.ts           # TypeScript type definitions
vendor/integration/    # Custom Astro integration for config loading
```

### Path Aliases

Use `~/` to import from `src/`:

```typescript
import Image from '~/components/common/Image.astro';
import { SITE } from 'astrowind:config';
```

### Configuration System

Site config lives in `src/config.yaml` and is loaded as a Vite virtual module `astrowind:config` by the custom integration in `vendor/integration/`. Exports: `SITE`, `I18N`, `METADATA`, `APP_BLOG`, `UI`, `ANALYTICS`.

## Tailwind CSS v4

Configuration is CSS-first in `src/assets/styles/tailwind.css`:

- **Theme tokens:** `@theme { --color-primary: var(--aw-color-primary); ... }`
- **Custom utilities:** `@utility bg-page { ... }`
- **Dark mode:** Class-based via `@variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))`
- **Plugins:** `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography"`
- **Custom variant:** `@custom-variant intersect (&:not([no-intersect]))`

CSS variables for colors/fonts are defined in `src/components/CustomStyles.astro` with light/dark theme variants.

The Vite plugin `@tailwindcss/vite` is configured in `astro.config.ts` (not as an Astro integration).

### Class Merging

Components use `twMerge` from `tailwind-merge` v3 for conditional class composition.

## Content Collections

Defined in `src/content.config.ts` using Astro's Content Layer API with `glob()` loader. Posts are in `src/data/post/` as `.md` or `.mdx` files.

Post frontmatter: `title` (required), `publishDate`, `updateDate`, `draft`, `excerpt`, `image`, `category`, `tags`, `author`, `metadata`.

## Component Patterns

- Props extend interfaces from `~/types`
- Use `class:list` for conditional classes
- Use `twMerge()` when accepting className overrides
- Use named slots for layout composition
- Widget components accept standardized props (see `~/types`)

## Image Handling

`src/components/common/Image.astro` supports:

- Local images via `astro:assets` (optimized by Sharp)
- Remote images via Unpic CDN
- Allowed domains (for providers Unpic can't detect, processed by Sharp): `cdn.pixabay.com`

Hero images use `loading="eager"` and `fetchpriority="high"`.

## Fonts

Fonts are handled by Astro's native **Fonts API**, configured in `astro.config.ts` under the `fonts` key (provider, family, `cssVariable`) and injected via the `<Font />` component in `src/layouts/Layout.astro`. Astro self-hosts, subsets, preloads, and generates metric-adjusted fallbacks. To change the typeface, edit the `fonts` entry and point `--aw-font-*` in `CustomStyles.astro` at the new `cssVariable`.

## Third-party Scripts (Partytown)

`@astrojs/partytown` is wired as an **opt-in** in `astro.config.ts`, gated behind `const hasExternalScripts = false`. Set it to `true` to offload third-party scripts (e.g. Google Analytics via `analytics.vendors.googleAnalytics.partytown`) to a web worker. It is disabled by default so the base template ships no external scripts.

## Content Security Policy

Astro's native CSP is intentionally **not** enabled in this version: it is incompatible with `<ClientRouter />` view transitions (shipped on by default) and would break the arbitrary third-party scripts a template user typically adds. CSP is deferred to AstroWind v2, where the component model (and optional SSR) make it clean and opt-in.

## Verification Checklist

After changes, always verify:

1. `pnpm build` succeeds
2. `pnpm check` passes (astro check + ESLint + Prettier)
3. Visual check in browser: homepage, contact page, mobile menu
4. Structured data describes the site it is on: the `WebSite` / `Organization` block in `src/pages/index.astro` is built only from `config.yaml`; anything you add there must be true for your site
